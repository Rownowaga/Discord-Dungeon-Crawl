Discord Dungeon is an interactive Choose Your Own Adventure-style game, built entirely within Discord. Players explore different text channels, each representing a room, where they encounter challenges, loot, and events. Through careful investigation and choices, they navigate a pre-determined map to uncover secrets and progress deeper into the adventure.

How It Works
Each text channel acts as a “page” in the adventure, setting a scene and presenting choices.

Players can investigate their surroundings for loot, hidden events, or unexpected challenges.

Once they’ve gathered enough information, they can move on to the next room based on the structured map.

Decisions shape the experience—what they discover or fail to find affects their journey.
